AMD is caused when water flows over or through sulfur-bearing materials forming solutions of net acidity. AMD comes mainly from abandoned coal mines and currently active mining. AMD degrades more than 4,500 stream miles in the mid-Atlantic region with the loss of aquatic life, and restricts stream use for recreation, public drinking water and industrial water supplies. What is Mine Drainage? \uf0b7 Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. \uf0b7 The runoff formed is usually acidic and frequently comes from areas where ore or coal mining activities have exposed rocks containing pyrite, a sulfur bearing mineral. \uf0b7 Metal-rich drainage can also occur in mineralized areas that have not been mined. How does Mine Drainage Occur? \uf0b7 Mine drainage is formed when pyrite, an iron sulfide, is exposed and reacts with air and water to form sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. \uf0b7 Some or all of this iron can precipitate to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage \uf0b7 The acid runoff further dissolves heavy metals such as copper, lead, mercury into ground or surface water \uf0b7 The rate and degree by which acid-mine drainage proceeds can be increased by the action of certain bacteria. Problems Associated with Mine Drainage \uf0b7 Contaminated drinking water \uf0b7 Disrupted growth and reproduction of aquatic plants and animals \uf0b7 Corroding effects of acid on parts of infrastructure such as bridges Acid Mine Drainage \uf0b7 Mines built as early as the 1800\u2019s were developed in a manner which utilized gravity drainage, to avoid excessive water accumulation in the mines \uf0b7 As a result, water polluted by acid, iron, sulfur and aluminum drained away from the mines and into streams Results of Acid Mine Drainage \uf0b7 Acid mine drainage is one of Region 3 most serious water pollution problems \uf0b7 It is not only an ecological concern to the states but an economic concern as well Economic Concerns Resulting from Acid Mine Drainage \uf0b7 A region impacted by acid mine drainage often has a decline in valued recreational fish species such as trout as well as a general decline in outdoor recreation and tourism along with contamination of groundwater drinking supplies Additional Information \uf0b7 For additional information regarding information on this page contact Dan Sweeney at 215-814-5731 \uf0b7 US EPA Region 3 Water Protection Division Nonpoint Source Pollution Program \uf0b7 Public Information Hotline - 800-438-2474</p>", "analytics": "{'Support Resource 4': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.013953488372093023, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.008935824532900094, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.09}}", "is_pdf": false, "pdf_url": "NONE"}}, "support_resources": {"4": {"id": 4, "title": "AMD main", "date_posted": "2020-02-24 20:24:57.152880", "notebook_id": 3, "relevance": 0.0, "content": "/static/notebook_files/support/cacc848afc896560.pdf", "analytics": "{'AMD summary': {'0': {'Cosine Similarity': 0.75, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.03946764570904082, 'Jaccard Similarity': 0.13617886178861788}, '1': {'Cosine Similarity': 0.7, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.023706896551724088, 'Jaccard Similarity': 0.1465798045602606}, '2': {'Cosine Similarity': 0.72, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.027215888194189075, 'Jaccard Similarity': 0.1438721136767318}, '3': {'Cosine Similarity': 0.67, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.041405873856523834, 'Jaccard Similarity': 0.13141683778234087}, '4': {'Cosine Similarity': 0.72, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.025856496444731758, 'Jaccard Similarity': 0.14143094841930118}, '5': {'Cosine Similarity': 0.57, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.023262839879154118, 'Jaccard Similarity': 0.08966565349544073}, '6': {'Cosine Similarity': 0.51, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.035355948399426684, 'Jaccard Similarity': 0.07297830374753451}, '7': {'Cosine Similarity': 0.21, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.025995125913891193, 'Jaccard Similarity': 0.04044117647058824}}}", "is_pdf": true, "pdf_url": "NONE"}}}
