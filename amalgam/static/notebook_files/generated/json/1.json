(C) CS</h4><p>It is not always obvious how to \u201ccarve nature at its joints\u201d (Plato). If one wants to understand a corporation, for example, should one think of it as a collection of departments? Or buildings? Project teams? Individual people? Knowing that multiple decompositions are possible, and often are necessary for answering different questions, is an important part of dealing productively with complex systems.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>You work at a hospital that\u2019s trying to reduce spending. Your manager asks you to make a diagram showing the structure of the organization, key functions, and the communication flows to identify inefficiencies. You are contemplating how to create this diagram. You first choose to represent different departments as group agents because the employees within each hold similar roles in your organization (nursing, doctors\u2026), and therefore are expected to act in a similar manner. While this decomposition shows significant interactions between large group agents such as the nursing teams and cleaning staff, there are no obvious inefficiencies. You then decide to decompose the system into functions and find a large amount of money being spent on educational campaigns overall. This was not obvious when the system was decomposed by department because education campaigns are funded by each department separately, at relatively low cost. You advise making educational campaigns a central process, consolidating common costs and being able to prioritize what should be budgeted. [Footnote: The system was decomposed in an intentional manner that best reflects the behavior being investigated. We can see how different decompositions may reveal different information about how the organization functions. In this case, decomposing by function allowed us to identify something that was replicated in each department, and thus driving an overall inefficiency in the system.]</p>", "analytics": "{'Support Resource 1': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.011560693641618497, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.005928853754940677, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.09}, 'Support Resource 2': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.011560693641618497, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.0039525691699604515, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.09}}", "is_pdf": false, "pdf_url": "NONE"}, "2": {"id": 2, "title": "#levelsofanalysis", "date_posted": "2020-02-27 23:51:08.211325", "notebook_id": 1, "relevance": 0.0, "content": "<h4>Describe interactions among events or characteristics of a system at different levels of analysis to generate explanations of phenomena.

For instance, the insurance adjuster seeking the cause of the house fire will not be interested in principles of combustion but rather may focus on someone\u2019s habit of leaving burning candles unwatched. Any event or system can be understood at multiple levels of analysis, and it is appropriate to focus on different levels for different purposes.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>You are considering why the suicide rates in Korean high schools are so high. You decide to split your analysis into three different levels: neurobiological, cognitive and social levels. You define neurobiological as the level at which neurotransmitters interact with each other, which accounts for physical causes of depression. This level is important because it might require clinical intervention. However, you recognize that at a higher cognitive level, there might be other causes for such behavior in the system: studies have shown that poor problem-solving skills might increase the chance of suicide because individuals fail to find solutions to their life problems. This is relevant because it can be improved through training in a top-down fashion. Finally, you look at the social level, and how people interact within schools. You notice that beyond the two previous levels, bullying and social isolation might also contribute to the behavior displayed in the system. You notice these levels interact with each other: bullying can create a problem by making an individual feel isolated, and their lack of problem-solving skills might then mean they can find no alternative to the problem. Additionally, though it is unclear whether this is causally related, bullying has been seen to affect serotonergic levels (in the neurobiological level of analysis), with low levels of serotonin correlated with bullying rates. These three levels can thus interact in multiple ways to create a state of depression that can lead to suicidal ideation and influence the behavior of the entire system. [Footnote: Analyzes and explains not only one but multiple levels of analysis, why they are focused on, and how they interact to explain the behavior of the system.]</p>", "analytics": "{'Support Resource 1': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.010638297872340425, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.001846722068328699, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.06}, 'Support Resource 2': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.010638297872340425, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.001846722068328699, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.06}}", "is_pdf": false, "pdf_url": "NONE"}, "3": {"id": 3, "title": "#emergentproperties", "date_posted": "2020-02-27 23:51:16.774741", "notebook_id": 1, "relevance": 0.0, "content": "<p>Some properties of systems, such as mass, are easily understood as trivial combinations of the properties of their parts. Other properties, such as an animal\u2019s reaction to a stimulus, can be more complex. Groups of people, in particular, are sometimes productively understood as \u201cgroup agents\u201d with identities of their own and behavioral tendencies not present in any of their individual members. The emergent behavior that results from interactions among agents in a complex system is nonlinear because it cannot be predicted simply by aggregating the behavior of the individuals in the system. Instead, one must observe interactions among agents in order to determine how emergent properties arise. Armed with such observations, one sometimes can anticipate effects of potential interventions.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>You watch an ant trail walk and wonder how the ants all know where to go and what they are doing. Your friend, surprisingly, is an ant connoisseur, and has studied their behavior in school. They tell you that the ant as an individual organism is actually quite limited, and is unable to reason or make complex decisions by itself. However, ants set out randomly to find food everyday and they walk around until they do. Once they do they release pheromones, which attracts other individual ants. All the ants you see in the trail, your friend tells you, have no idea where they\u2019re going, and all they do is make the simple decision of following the pheromones without any complex awareness of what function they are serving. You realize that ant colonies display emergent behaviors: from what your friend told you, the simple, individual behaviors of each agent interact to create overarching complex tasks, such as finding and mobilizing food supplies. The larger behavior cannot be reduced to the characteristics of each individual agent, since each ant only makes the simple decision to follow a pheromone. Rather, the seemingly simple and random behavior of each individual ant is what gives rise to the emergent property of a food trail. You realize that without this emergent property, individual ants would likely not survive by themselves, and certainly a colony with more than thousands of ants would not be a sustainable option, making this emergence a necessary part of an ant colony\u2019s survival. [Footnote: Foraging and mobilizing food is identified as a property emerging from the combination of individual ant behaviors, and because it cannot be reduced to any individual ant\u2019s capabilities or properties, it is classified as emergent. The relevance of the property is highlighted in discussing the necessity of such emergent behavior for the survival of the social system.]</p>", "analytics": "{'Support Resource 1': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.010526315789473684, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.0009199632014719183, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.07}, 'Support Resource 2': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.010526315789473684, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.0009199632014719183, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.07}}", "is_pdf": false, "pdf_url": "NONE"}, "4": {"id": 4, "title": "#multiplecauses", "date_posted": "2020-02-27 23:51:24.252865", "notebook_id": 1, "relevance": 0.0, "content": "<h4>Identify ways that multiple causes interact to produce complex effects.

You realize you need to first understand what causes homelessness in order to approach ending it. You identify three main causes: drug addiction, mental health issues and bad financial status. You consider how these might interact and perhaps lead to or reinforce one another. Drugs may worsen, or cause, mental illness. These, in turn, can cause financial challenges. However, drugs can also be the direct cause of financial struggles, even if mental illness is not involved. You realize there is no single necessary cause for homelessness you could target, but rather a number of sufficient causes. This means the best way to approach the problem would be to evaluate these causes and find the ones that most bear on homelessness. You realize that because drugs and mental health issues can cause financial struggles to a larger extent than the opposite, it might be more useful to start by tackling them first. Tackling financial struggles would require you to also tackle drugs and mental health issues, since they are higher-order causes. You therefore propose to the city government to start drug addiction recovery services for the homeless, hoping that this would improve mental health and financial conditions of the homeless.

(C) CS</h4><p>Networks arise from specific kinds of relations and interactions within a system. Social networks, which facilitate the transmission of information and influence among individuals, are a particularly salient example. Such networks can be analyzed in detail, often specified as a set of nodes and connections among them, where each node represents a person or group and connections specify relationships and types of interaction. In social networks, connections across the network can affect what people believe, know, and how they feel and act. Recognizing the immediate effects of an event in a network, as well as further effects that result, can help one to analyze the functioning of a system and determine effective ways of interacting with it.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>You notice that a group of your friends are losing weight dramatically. You ask them what\u2019s going on, and learn that they\u2019ve all decided to begin a new diet where they eat as our pre-agrarian ancestors did: a \u201cpaleo diet.\u201d They learned this from one of the most popular students in your school, who read about it in a news article. This one student is an extrovert and is part of several different friend groups, holding a strong influence over each. You notice that he acts like a hub in your school\u2019s network, connecting different friend groups that are clustered and very closely connected. Because of this, you realize that if this same student were to be removed from the school, or adopted a new diet, the entire school would probably be affected. Although your friend group is not entirely connected to him, one of your close friends has a class with him, and she is the one who advised all your other friends to adopt this diet. You recognize this as a network effect, propagating quickly to all the nodes in the network because of the density of different friend group and the connectivity of the major hub from where this diet fad started. The network effect has reached you as a secondary effect, and you consider adopting the paleo diet too because your entire group is now trying it. [Footnote: The description of the network elucidates how it\u2019s topology and structure (a mixture of small-world, dense clusters with a scale-free centralized hub that connects to all these) allows network effects to propagate easily from the hub outwards toward other nodes and leads to secondary network effects.]</p>", "analytics": "{'Support Resource 1': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.005128205128205128, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.0018993352326686086, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.05}, 'Support Resource 2': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.005128205128205128, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.0047483380816714105, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.05}}", "is_pdf": false, "pdf_url": "NONE"}, "6": {"id": 6, "title": "#systemdynamics", "date_posted": "2020-02-27 23:51:40.803263", "notebook_id": 1, "relevance": 0.0, "content": "<h4>Recognize the role of attractors and sensitivity to varying conditions in the behavior of complex systems. (C) CS</h4><p>Many systems\u2014including complex and chaotic systems\u2014will behave in an orderly and predictable manner within a specific range of conditions over a certain period of time. In complex systems, \u201cattractors\u201d represent natural equilibrium states. When systems are subjected to varying external stimuli, such as random noise or targeted interventions, this can disrupt system dynamics. In a merely complicated system, such as a piece of engineering (e.g., a jet engine or grandfather clock), these influences typically degrade performance. In some complex systems, however, they can push the system into a qualitatively different and possibly adaptive type of behavior, improving system performance. Recognizing the attractor states of a system, and also why systems respond to variable external stimuli in such different ways can help one understand how to interact effectively with them.</p><h3>Example</h3><p>You are teaching a class on antidepressants, and are trying to explain to your students how levels of serotonin in the brain interacts with or causes depression. You decide to analyze the state of an individual\u2019s mental health through a systems dynamics lens, creating a simplified phase space containing level of serotonin versus levels of subjective happiness. You identify the attractor basins in your diagram, with the upper right corner (moderate to high levels of both) being a stable happy or even joyful state and the lower left corner (low levels of both) being a depressed state. You also consider an attractor basin where there are high levels of serotonin but low levels of subjective happiness, accounting for other non-neurological causes for depressed states despite clinically normal (high) levels of serotonin. However, you make this attractor basin weaker than the other two, given it is theorized to be brought upon by events that cause temporary periods of sadness (such as the death of a loved one) rather than a persistent depression. You then identify possible noise or interventions that can be introduced to the system, like the introduction of medication: by increasing serotonin release it causes a regime shift that tips the system\u2019s state from one in the lower left attractor basin (depressed) to the upper right one (moderately happy to joyful). You then consider testing how many milligrams of the antidepressant needs to be prescribed for a depressed patient to reach a critical point, and thus cause the phase shift. This critical point is the medication\u2019s aim, but you don\u2019t know where it lies in the phase space, and explain to your students that this is what doctors need to figure out for each patient. You also explain that although the serotonin levels might be clinically normal in the non-neurological depressed state, the medication might help the patient with sensitivity to the hormone, and this can also create a phase space towards the desired attractor. [Footnote: You create a phase space and identify the relevant attractors, explaining how the system\u2019s state is defined by the interaction of serotonin and the brain. You also explain the non-neurological attractor and analyze how interventions in the form of noise (external events or antidepressants) can change the state of a system by reaching critical points.]</p>", "analytics": "{'Support Resource 1': {'Jaccard Similarity': 0.008888888888888889, 'Word Mover': 1000, 'Text Distance': 0.001463057790782707, 'Cosine Similarity': 0.08}, 'Support
